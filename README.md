# Where is the street?

This is a small shiny game that can help you learn the street names of Ulm interactively. The underlying map data (`street_lines_ulm.rds`) was extracted from OpenStreetMap. The `background_map.rds` file consists of background image data of the maps. These images were downloaded with [{ggmap}](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap).
